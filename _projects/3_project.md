The THEIA project – in copromotion with University of Porto (UPorto) - aims to improve the sensorial capacities of autonomous vehicle, implementing and validating perception algorithms based on data collected by sensors – with specially focus on the LiDAR sensor –, to build a precise, robust and safe vision of the surrounding. This project appears as an answer to the autonomous driving necessities/trends, namely on demand of integral perception of vehicle’s surrounding, external conditions that may affect the driving quality (e.g. meteorological conditions), and characterization of critical scenarios by means of tests and validations carried in lab context to ensure a better and advanced perception, compared to that of the human being.
