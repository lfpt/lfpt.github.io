Telecommunications and computer vision have evolved as separate scientific areas. This is envisioned to change with the advent of wireless communications with radios characterised by line-of-sight ranges, which could benefit from visual data to predict the wireless channel dynamics. Computer vision applications will also become more robust if helped by radio-based imaging. This new joint research field relies on wireless communications, computer vision, sensing and machine learning, and it has a high innovation potential because of the large domain of innovative applications it enables and the relevant know-how available in Europe. 

The main objective of the CONVERGE project is the development of an innovative toolset aligned with the motto “view-to-communicate and communicate-to-view”. This toolset is a world-first and consists of vision-aided large intelligent surfaces, vision-aided fixed and mobile base stations, a vision-radio simulator and 3D environment modeler, and machine learning algorithms for multimodal data including radio signals, video streams, RF sensing, and traffic traces.
