The project aims to develop a new IIoT/IoRT system applicable in a transversal and flexible way to the quality inspection and quality control process in complex production lines in the automotive industry, including environmental and energy monitoring, waste water and gas treatment. Collaborative robotic systems (with integration of robotic manipulators and controllers) and artificial vision mechanisms integrated into an IIoT/IoRT sensing ecosystem will be investigated and developed, namely:

    Collaborative robotic system for visual inspection and quality control in dynamic regimes;
    Robotic system in mobile and portable unit for identification and analysis of nonconformities.

These integrate with artificial vision algorithms, in order to achieve properties of versatility, flexibility and transparency in the identification of nonconformities, including the capacity of self-reprogramming/self-reconfiguration through intelligent self-learning.
