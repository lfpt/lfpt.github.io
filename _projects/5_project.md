The overall objective of the INDTECH 4.0 project is the design and development of innovative technologies in the context of Industry 4.0/Factories of the Future (FoF), using the mobilization of multiple business partners and research centers, as well as the leadership of an assembly unit for vehicles (Original Equipment Manufacturer, OEM) - Stellantis Mangualde - as a reference field for experimentation, demonstration and technological validation.

The critical technologies to be developed, prototyped and tested are focused on the following core areas:

(i) Intelligent robotic systems (Collaborative Robotics)

(ii) Advanced inspection systems (Computer Vision)

(iii) Autonomous handling systems ( Mobile Robotics â€“ Autonomous Guided Vehicles)

(iv) Digitization and virtualization of the factory floor (Cyber-physical Production Systems)

(v) Decision Support Systems (DSS) based on advanced models of planning/simulation/optimization of Law Suit.
