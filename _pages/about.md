I am an Associate Professor at [DEI](https://dei.fe.up.pt/)/[FEUP](https://www.fe.up.pt/) and a Senior Researcher at [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/), where I'm part of the [Visual Computing and Machine Intelligence](http://vcmi.inesctec.pt/) Group. At VCMI we focus our research on computer vision and pattern recognition. Please check out our group website for the most up-to-date information.

My main research focus is on developing and applying computer vision and machine learning methodologies. I've worked in many domains including industry, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. More recently, I've focused in challenges related to interpretability and robustness.

Before joining FEUP, I was working as a Senior Researcher at [Fraunhofer AICOS](). I completed my PhD in 2009
